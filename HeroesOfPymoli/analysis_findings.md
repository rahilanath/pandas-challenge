### Findings
The dataset and the data frames that were created in the assignment are geared towards supporting the in-app-purchases (IAP) business model. With that in mind here are my findings:

1) The overwhelming majority (84%) of players are males with the most # of purchases being in the 20-24 age range. The game devs have clearly made an MMO version of Call of Duty Modern Warfare. Jokes aside, the target demographic for game devs would be males in the 20-24 age range for any cosmetic items.

2) Both the overall average purchase price and the average purchase price for male players is between $3.02 and $3.05. This would lead to the ideal pricing for items aimed for the male 20-24 age demographic: ~3$.

3) When looking at the most purchased item and most popular item data frames, it's clear that ripping off Game of Thrones sword names nets more profit. Game devs would see an increase in sales and number of item purchases by acquiring cross-branding licensces from other popular fantasy Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-like IPs.

### Take Aways
While the dataset and the data frames point out some interesting demographic trends, the game devs would be able to pin-point their target audience by grouping the # of purchases per player by gender and age-range.
